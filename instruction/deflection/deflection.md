# Deflection

Deflection, in chess, is a tactical maneuver that forces an opponent's piece to move away from a strategically important square, line, or duty, thereby weakening their position. It's a powerful technique because it exploits the fact that pieces are often tied to the defense of critical squares or other pieces. By forcing a piece to abandon its post, you can create weaknesses and open up opportunities for attack. Deflection can be a precursor to a direct attack, a discovered attack, or even a decisive material gain.

Understanding deflection requires recognizing which pieces are crucial for defending key areas and then devising a plan to make them move. This involves calculation, pattern recognition, and an understanding of positional weaknesses.

## Identifying Deflection Opportunities

The first step in using deflection is to identify potential targets. Look for pieces that are:

*   Guarding important squares for the opponent. For example, a knight might be defending a pawn from capture, or a rook may be blocking an open file.
*   Protecting other valuable pieces. A queen might be shielding a rook from an attack.
*   Controlling key files or diagonals. A bishop might be preventing your pieces from advancing.

Once you've identified a potential target, ask yourself: "What would happen if that piece moved?" If the consequences are favorable to you, then deflection might be a viable tactic.

## Methods of Deflection

There are several ways to deflect a piece. These methods often involve sacrifices or threats that the opponent must address.

*   **Sacrifice:** Offering a piece to force the opponent to capture it, thereby moving the defending piece. This is a common and powerful deflection technique.
    *   *Example:* Imagine a queen is guarding a checkmating square. You sacrifice a knight on that square. If the queen captures, the king is checkmated.
*   **Threat:** Creating a direct threat to a different piece that the defender must address.
    *   *Example:* Your opponent's rook is guarding their queen. You attack the rook with a pawn. To save the rook, the opponent must move it, leaving the queen undefended.
*   **Overloading:** Forcing the defender to take on too many defensive duties. This can be achieved by attacking multiple targets simultaneously.
    *   *Example:* The opponent's knight is defending both a pawn and their king (preventing a discovered attack). By attacking the pawn, you force the knight to choose which duty to fulfill. If it saves the pawn, the king is vulnerable to the discovered attack.
*   **Pin:** While pins often restrict movement, they can also be used to set up deflections. A pinned piece is often tied to its defensive duty.
    *   *Example:* A knight is pinned to the king, and is defending a rook. By attacking the rook, you force the opponent to either lose the rook or break the pin, potentially exposing the king to danger.

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some concrete examples of deflection in action.

**Example 1: A Simple Sacrifice**

White to move.

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3"]
```

Imagine the position above developed into the following:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4"]
```

And then further developed into:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5"]
```

And finally into:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6"]
```

Now imagine the position is:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6"]
```

And you develop the bishop to e2:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7"]
```

Let's say black develops their queen to e7:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8"]
```

And white castles:

```
[FEN "rnbqkb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9"]
```

Black castles:

```
[FEN "rnbq1rk1/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10"]
```

And now the position is:

```
[FEN "rnbq1rk1/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10"]
```

White can play Nd5! This is a deflection sacrifice. The black queen is defending the f7 pawn, which is a key weakness. If black captures with Qxd5, then white can play exd5, opening the e-file for an attack on the black king. This is a classic example of using a sacrifice to deflect a defender and create a powerful attacking opportunity.

**Example 2: Using a Threat**

White to move.

```
[FEN "rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 4 5"]
```

Imagine the game develops like this:

```
[FEN "rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 4 5"]
```

```
[FEN "rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 4 5"]
```

```
[FEN "rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6"]
```

```
[FEN "rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6"]
```

```

```
