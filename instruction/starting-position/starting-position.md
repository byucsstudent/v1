# Starting Position

Setting up the chessboard correctly is the first, and arguably one of the most important, steps in any chess game. An incorrect setup can lead to confusion, miscalculations, and ultimately, an unfair game. This section will guide you through the proper arrangement of the board and pieces, ensuring a smooth and accurate start to your chess journey.

### The Chessboard Orientation

The chessboard is a square board consisting of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. These squares alternate in color, typically between light (white) and dark (black). The first thing you need to know is how to orient the board correctly.

The golden rule is: **"White on the right."**

This means that the square in the bottom right-hand corner from your perspective (as White) *must* be a white square. If that square is black, you've rotated the board 90 degrees and need to turn it until the white square is in the correct place. For Black, the bottom right-hand corner should also be a white square.

Think of it this way: if you're sitting down to play as White, the white square should be on your right hand side. If you're sitting down to play as Black, the white square should *still* be on your right hand side.

### Piece Placement: The Back Rank

Once the board is correctly oriented, we can begin placing the pieces. We'll start with the back rank, the row closest to each player.

From left to right (from White's perspective):

*   **Rooks:** Place the rooks on the corners of the board (a1 and h1 for White, a8 and h8 for Black). Rooks are the pieces that move horizontally and vertically.
*   **Knights:** Place the knights next to the rooks (b1 and g1 for White, b8 and g8 for Black). Knights are the only pieces that can jump over other pieces.
*   **Bishops:** Place the bishops next to the knights (c1 and f1 for White, c8 and f8 for Black). Bishops move diagonally.
*   **Queen:** The queen goes on her *own* color. This means the white queen goes on the white square (d1), and the black queen goes on the black square (d8). Remember: "Queen on her color."
*   **King:** The king occupies the remaining square next to the queen (e1 for White, e8 for Black).

A helpful mnemonic to remember the order of the pieces on the back rank is: **R**ooks, **K**nights, **B**ishops, **Q**ueen, **K**ing, **B**ishops, **K**nights, **R**ooks. (RKBQKBKR)

### Piece Placement: The Pawns

After the back rank is set, the pawns are placed. Each player has eight pawns, and they are all placed on the second rank in front of the other pieces. For White, the pawns go on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, and h2. For Black, the pawns go on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, and h7.

Pawns are unique because they move differently than they capture. They generally move forward one square, but they capture diagonally.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

*   **Incorrect Board Orientation:** This is the most common mistake. Always double-check that the white square is on the right.
    *   **Solution:** Before placing any pieces, make it a habit to check the color of the bottom right-hand square.
*   **Queen and King Placement:** Players sometimes mix up the queen and king. Remember, the queen goes on her own color!
    *   **Solution:** Say the phrase "Queen on her color" out loud as you place the queen.
*   **Forgetting the Pawns:** It's easy to get caught up in placing the major pieces and forget the pawns.
    *   **Solution:** After setting the back rank, immediately place all eight pawns.

### Practical Example

Let's say you're setting up the board as White. You place the rooks in the corners (a1 and h1). Then you put the knights next to them (b1 and g1). The bishops follow (c1 and f1). Now, remember "Queen on her color"! Since you are white, the white queen goes on the white square (d1). Finally, the king goes on the remaining square (e1). Then, you finish up by placing all eight pawns on the second rank (a2 through h2).

### Engagement and Practice

To solidify your understanding, try setting up the board from memory several times. You can also use a chess app or website to check your setup against the correct position. Practice makes perfect!

Consider these questions:

*   Why do you think it's important to have a standardized starting position in chess?
*   What are some other games that rely on a precise initial setup?
*   What strategies can you use to help remember the correct piece placement?

### Summary

Setting up the chessboard correctly is a fundamental skill for any chess player. By following the "White on the right" rule and remembering the correct piece placement, you can ensure a fair and accurate start to your games. Consistent practice and attention to detail will make this process second nature, allowing you to focus on strategy and tactics from the very first move.
